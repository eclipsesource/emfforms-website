EMF Forms provides components and APIs to implement complex UI elements such as tables, trees and editors to modify your domain data. Please have a look at the [EMF Forms table framework](https://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2018/01/31/emf-forms-1-15-0-feature-enhanced-table-renderer/), the [EMF Forms tree renderer](https://eclipsesource.com/blogs/tutorials/emf-forms-view-model-elements/#treemasterdetail) and the [EMF Forms Editors](https://eclipsesource.com/blogs/tutorials/emf-forms-editors).
