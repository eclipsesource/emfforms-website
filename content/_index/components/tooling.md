EMF Forms provides powerful tooling for the creation, evolution and maintainence of UIs for a very fast turn-around. It allows you to generate a first version directly from the underlying data model. Based on the intial state you can iterativly refine the UI in a visual editor including a preview, drag and drop and support for advanced elements such as rule-based visibility.
