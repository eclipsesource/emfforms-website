EMF Forms and the EMF Client Platform provide a new way of developing UIs. Instead of manually coding form-based layouts, trees or tables, it allows you to describe the UI with a simple model instead of with code. The approach allows you to more efficiently produce and iteratively refine data-centric UIs that conform to a uniform look and feel. This also lowers the technical entry barrier to creating form-based UIs. The UI description is interpreted by a rendering engine and allows you to switch between the UI technology stack e.g. to the web - just by replacing the renderer.</p>
